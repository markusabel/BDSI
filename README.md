## Structure and Versioning
There are three folders, one contains the integration routines for the dynamical systems used in the publication, the other, _utils_, contains the procedures used to produce the graphics of the publication, the third folder noise_models.

The version of the code is found by the usual _git tag_ command.  
The version used to reproduce the publication results is 9.3
